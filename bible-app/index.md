Welcome to Bible App - a simple, offline-capable Bible reading experience designed to help you engage with Scripture anytime, anywhere.

## Get Started

### Android
Download the latest APK for Android devices:

[📥 Download for Android](https://github.com/your-username/bible-app/releases/download/v1.0.0/BibleApp.apk)

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
Use Bible App directly in your browser with full offline support:

[🌐 Launch Web App](https://your-username.github.io/bible-app)

To install a Progressive Web App (PWA) on an iOS device, you must use the Safari browser, as iOS only supports PWA installation through Safari. The process is straightforward and involves the following steps:

- Open the Safari browser on your iPhone or iPad.
- Navigate to the website of the PWA you wish to install.
- Tap the share icon (a square with an upward arrow) located at the bottom of the screen.
- From the share menu, select "Add to Home Screen".
- Optionally, you can rename the app shortcut to a preferred name before adding it.
- Tap "Add" to confirm the installation.

Once installed, the PWA will appear on your home screen and can be launched like a native app. This method works on iOS 16.3 and later, with support available from Safari, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Orion browsers on iOS 16.4 and newer.

*The PWA works on all modern browsers and can be installed to your home screen for a native app experience.*
